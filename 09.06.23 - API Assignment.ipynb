    "# Access to External Services: APIs allow applications to tap into external services and resources, such as payment processing, maps, social media\n",

    "\n",
    "# Security: APIs often come with built-in security measures, such as authentication and authorization mechanisms, to protect data and resources.\n",
    "# Developers can rely on these security features instead of reinventing the wheel.\n",

    "# Scalability: APIs can handle a large number of requests, making it possible for applications to scale as needed. Cloud-based APIs, in particular,\n",
    "# can auto-scale to accommodate increasing traffic.\n",

    "# Cost-Effective: Building and maintaining certain functionalities in-house can be costly and time-consuming. APIs allow organizations to leverage\n",

    "# Web-Based: Web APIs are designed for web-based interactions, making them particularly well-suited for enabling communication between web servers\n",
    "# and client applications, including web browsers, mobile apps, and other web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Endpoints: Web APIs define a set of endpoints (URLs) that clients can use to request data or perform actions. These endpoints often follow REST\n",
    "# (Representational State Transfer) or other web-based architectural patterns.\n",
    "\n",
