    "# Replace Categories with Ranks: Replace the original categories in the dataset with these ordinal ranks.\n",

    "# This technique is particularly useful in scenarios where the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable is essential.\n",
    "# For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Marketing Campaigns: When categorizing customers based on their responsiveness to marketing campaigns, Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can assign\n",
