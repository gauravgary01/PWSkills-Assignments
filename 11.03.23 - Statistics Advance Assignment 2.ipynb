    "# The Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are mathematical concepts used in probability and statistics\n",

    "# Let's consider a six-sided fair die as an example. The PMF for the outcome of rolling the die can be expressed as follows:\n",

    "# The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental theorem in statistics that describes the behavior of the sampling distribution\n",

    "# In essence, the CLT states that as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution,\n",
    "# regardless of the original population's distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Central Limit Theorem can be stated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "# If you take random samples of a sufficiently large size (usually n ≥ 30) from a population with any shape of distribution, the\n",
    "# distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed. The mean of the sample means will be approximately equal to the\n",
    "# population mean, and the standard deviation of the sample means (known as the standard error) will be approximately equal to the population\n",
    "# standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Significance of the Central Limit Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Normal Approximation: The CLT allows statisticians and researchers to approximate the distribution of the sample mean (or other\n",
    "# sample statistics) as a normal distribution. This is valuable because normal distributions have well-understood properties and are\n",
    "# easier to work with in statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# General Applicability: The CLT is widely applicable because it does not depend on the shape of the original population distribution.\n",
    "# It holds for populations that are not normal, making it a powerful tool for statistical inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample Size Independence: The CLT is not limited to specific population distributions or sample sizes. It works for a variety of scenarios,\n",
    "# and the sample size required for the CLT to hold can be quite small in some cases (as small as n = 30).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basis for Hypothesis Testing: The CLT is the foundation of many statistical methods, including hypothesis testing and confidence interval\n",
    "# construction. It enables the use of z-scores and the normal distribution in these procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Real-World Applications: The CLT is commonly used in practice for various applications, such as estimating population parameters, quality\n",
    "# control, financial analysis, and medical research, where it simplifies and enhances statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assumption Testing: The CLT is employed in assessing the validity of statistical assumptions. For example, it helps verify whether the\n",
    "# assumption of normality holds for certain tests or models by examining the distribution of residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In summary, the Central Limit Theorem is a cornerstone of statistical theory that plays a critical role in making statistical inferences\n",
    "# and conducting hypothesis tests in practice. Its significance lies in its broad applicability and the assurance that, under certain\n",
    "# conditions, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will closely resemble a normal distribution, regardless of the population's\n",
    "# distribution. This has far-reaching implications for data analysis and decision-making in various fields."

    "\n",
    "# Independence: The samples used to compute the sample mean (or other sample statistics) must be drawn independently. This means that the\n",
    "# value of one observation should not be influenced by the value of any other observation in the sample. In the case of time-series data,\n",
    "# observations taken at different time points should be sufficiently separated.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample Size: The sample size should be sufficiently large. There is no strict rule for the minimum sample size, but a commonly used guideline\n",
    "# is n ≥ 30. The larger the sample size, the closer the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be to a normal distribution.\n",
    "# However, smaller sample sizes may still yield approximately normal distributions if the population distribution is not heavily skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Population Distribution: The CLT assumes that the population from which the samples are drawn has a finite mean (μ) and a\n",
    "# finite variance (σ^2). In other words, the population should have well-defined and finite central moments. The CLT does not\n",
    "# require the population to be normally distributed. It can apply to a wide range of population distributions, including non-normal\n",
    "# distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Random Sampling: Samples must be drawn randomly from the population, meaning that every member of the population has an equal chance\n",
    "# of being selected. Non-random or biased sampling can lead to violations of the CLT assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Finite Population Correction (optional): If the population size is small (relative to the sample size), a finite population correction\n",
    "# (FPC) may be applied to adjust the standard error of the sample mean. The FPC becomes significant when the sample size is a substantial\n",
    "# fraction of the population size.\n",
