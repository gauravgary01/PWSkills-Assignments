    "# Bagging, which stands for Bootstrap Aggregating, is a technique used to reduce overfitting in decision trees by combining the predictions of\n",
    "# multiple trees trained on different subsets of the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's how bagging helps reduce overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Bootstrap Sampling: Bagging involves creating multiple bootstrap samples of the training data. Bootstrap sampling involves randomly selecting subsets of the\n",
    "# training data with replacement. This means that each bootstrap sample may contain duplicate instances and some instances may be left out.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Training Multiple Trees: With each bootstrap sample, a decision tree is trained. Since each tree sees a slightly different subset of the data due to bootstrap\n",
    "# sampling, they will each learn slightly different patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Combining Predictions: Once all the trees are trained, predictions are made by aggregating the predictions of all the individual trees. For regression tasks, this\n",
    "# typically involves averaging the predictions of all trees, while for classification tasks, it involves majority voting.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Reducing Variance: By combining the predictions of multiple trees trained on different subsets of data, bagging reduces the variance of the model. This is because\n",
    "# the errors of individual trees tend to cancel each other out when combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Increasing Stability: Bagging also increases the stability of the model by reducing the impact of outliers or noise in the data. Since each tree is trained on a\n",
    "# different subset of data, they are less likely to be influenced by outliers or noise present in any single subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overall, by averaging the predictions of multiple trees trained on different subsets of data, bagging helps to create a more robust and generalizable model that is\n",
    "# less prone to overfitting."

    "# Flexibility: Using different types of base learners allows flexibility in modeling different types of data and problems. For example, combining decision trees with\n",

    "# Disadvantages:\n",

    "# c. As a rule of thumb, starting with a moderate ensemble size (e.g., 50-100 models) is often a good starting point and then adjusting based on empirical results.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Stability of Predictions:\n",
    "# a. Increasing the ensemble size can also lead to more stable predictions, as the variability in predictions from individual models gets averaged out.\n",
