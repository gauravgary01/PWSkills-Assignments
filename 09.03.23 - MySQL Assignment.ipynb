    "# A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, management, and\n",
    "# manipulation of data. Databases are used to store and manage large amounts of information, making it easier to access and work with data\n",
    "# for various applications and purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# There are two main categories of databases: SQL (Structured Query Language) databases and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases. Here's a differentiation\n",
    "# between the two:\n",
    "    \n",
    "# SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Structured Data: SQL databases are relational databases that store structured data in tables with predefined schemas. Each table consists\n",
    "# of rows and columns, and the relationships between tables are defined using foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ACID Compliance: SQL databases are known for their strong consistency and adherence to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)\n",
    "# properties, ensuring data integrity and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Schema: SQL databases require a fixed schema, which means that the structure of the data (table columns and their types) needs to be defined before\n",
    "# data insertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Query Language: SQL databases use a standardized query language called SQL for data manipulation and retrieval. SQL provides powerful capabilities\n",
    "# for complex queries, joins, and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scalability: SQL databases are typically designed for vertical scalability, which means that increasing their performance usually involves upgrading\n",
    "# hardware or adding more powerful servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server are some popular SQL database management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Flexible Data Models: NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, making them suitable for various types of data,\n",
    "# including JSON, XML, key-value pairs, and document-based data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# BASE Semantics: NoSQL databases often follow the BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) model, which prioritizes availability\n",
    "# and scalability over strict consistency. This makes them suitable for distributed and highly available systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Schema-less: NoSQL databases are schema-less, meaning that you can insert data without a predefined schema. This flexibility allows for agile\n",
    "# development and handling of evolving data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Query Languages: NoSQL databases use different query languages or APIs tailored to the specific database type. These languages may be less expressive\n",
    "# than SQL but are designed to work with the database's data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scalability: NoSQL databases are often designed for horizontal scalability, which involves adding more servers or nodes to distribute the data and\n",
    "# handle increased loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Couchbase are some popular NoSQL database systems."

    "# In SQL, a query typically consists of several clauses that are executed in a specific order. The order of execution of SQL clauses in a\n",
    "# query generally follows this sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "# FROM: The FROM clause specifies the tables from which you are retrieving data. It is the first clause in the query and defines the source\n",
    "# tables for the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "# JOIN: If your query involves multiple tables and requires combining data from these tables, the JOIN clause is used to establish the relationships\n",
    "# between the tables. JOINs can be INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, or FULL JOIN, depending on how you want to join the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# WHERE: The WHERE clause is used to filter rows from the tables specified in the FROM clause. It defines the conditions that rows must meet\n",
    "# to be included in the result set. Rows that don't satisfy the WHERE conditions are excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "# GROUP BY: If you need to group rows based on one or more columns, you can use the GROUP BY clause. It is typically followed by aggregate\n",
    "# functions (e.g., COUNT, SUM, AVG) to perform calculations on groups of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "# HAVING: The HAVING clause is used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause to filter grouped rows based on aggregate values. It specifies\n",
    "# conditions that apply to groups, similar to the WHERE clause for individual rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SELECT: The SELECT clause determines which columns from the tables and expressions should be included in the result set. It follows the\n",
    "# previous clauses and specifies what data you want to retrieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "# DISTINCT: If you want to remove duplicate rows from the result set, you can use the DISTINCT keyword in the SELECT clause. It ensures that\n",
    "# only unique rows are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns. You can specify the sorting order (ASC for ascending\n",
    "# or DESC for descending).\n",
    "\n",
    "# LIMIT/OFFSET: If you want to limit the number of rows returned or skip a certain number of rows, you can use the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses.\n",
    "# These are often used for pagination or restricting query results to a specific range.\n",
    "\n",
    "# UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT: If you need to combine results from multiple queries, you can use UNION (to combine and remove duplicates), INTERSECT\n",
    "# (to return common rows), or EXCEPT (to return rows from the first query that are not in the second query).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Parentheses: Parentheses can be used to group conditions and subqueries within the clauses, controlling the order of evaluation when complex\n",
    "# queries are involved."
