    "# Lasso Regression: It performs both variable selection and regularization by adding a penalty equivalent to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Ridge Regression: It uses L2 regularization by adding a penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. Ridge doesn't perform variable selection\n",

    "# Elastic Net Regression: It combines the penalties of Lasso and Ridge by adding both L1 and L2 regularization terms to the loss function. This hybrid approach helps\n",
    "# in addressing some limitations of both Lasso and Ridge. Elastic Net can handle highly correlated predictors better than Lasso and still performs feature selection\n",
    "# like Lasso while also handling situations where there are more predictors than observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In summary, Elastic Net Regression stands out by providing a balance between Lasso and Ridge techniques, allowing it to handle the shortcomings of each method\n",

    "# Pickling a model in machine learning refers to the process of serializing the trained model object into a byte stream. This serialized object\n",

    "\n",
    "# 1. Persistence: Pickling allows you to save trained models to disk. This is beneficial when you want to reuse the model for making predictions on new data\n",
    "# without having to retrain it every time. It helps in preserving the state of the trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Deployment: Serialized models can be easily deployed in production environments. Once a model is trained and pickled, it can be loaded and used in various\n",
    "# applications, such as web services, mobile apps, or other systems, without needing the original training code or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Sharing and Collaboration: Pickled models can be shared with collaborators or other team members. This facilitates collaboration, allowing others to use the\n",
    "# trained model without needing access to the original training data or environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Version Control: Serialized models can be versioned alongside your codebase, enabling better management and tracking of model versions used in different\n",
    "# releases or experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Efficiency: Loading a pickled model is often faster than retraining a model from scratch. It saves time, especially when dealing with large or complex models\n",

    "\n",
