    "# The Filter method in feature selection is a technique used to identify the most relevant features in a dataset\n",

    "\n",
    "# Feature Scoring: Each feature is scored individually using statistical methods like correlation coefficient, mutual information,\n",

    "\n",
    "# Ranking or Thresholding: Features are ranked based on their scores, or a threshold is set to select the top features. Features above\n",

    "# Independence from the Learning Algorithm: The filter method does not involve the learning algorithm used for modeling. It evaluates\n",
