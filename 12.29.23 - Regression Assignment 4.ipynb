    "# Lasso Regression is a technique used in machine learning and statistics for regression analysis. It stands for Least\n",
    "# Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. It's similar to ridge regression but incorporates a regularization term that helps\n",
    "# with feature selection by penalizing the absolute size of coefficients, effectively shrinking some coefficients to zero. Here's\n",
    "# a breakdown of its key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Regularization: Lasso Regression adds a penalty term to the standard linear regression cost function, which is the sum of squared\n",
    "# differences between the predicted and actual values. This penalty term is the absolute sum of the coefficients multiplied by a\n",
    "# regularization parameter (lambda or alpha).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Feature Selection: The unique aspect of Lasso is its ability to perform feature selection by driving some coefficients to exactly\n",
    "# zero. This means it can effectively eliminate certain features from the model, making it useful when dealing with datasets with many\n",
    "# features, some of which may not be relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Shrinking Coefficients: By shrinking coefficients, Lasso helps prevent overfitting and simplifies the model by excluding unnecessary\n",
    "# features. This leads to a more interpretable and potentially more accurate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Differences from Other Regression Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Ridge Regression: Both Lasso and Ridge Regression use regularization, but Lasso tends to shrink coefficients to zero more aggressively,\n",
    "# resulting in more sparsity and feature selection compared to Ridge Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Elastic Net: Elastic Net is a hybrid of Lasso and Ridge Regression, combining their penalties. It addresses some limitations of Lasso,\n",
    "# especially when dealing with highly correlated features, by still allowing groups of correlated features to be selected together.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression: OLS doesn’t have a regularization term, so it doesn’t handle multicollinearity or perform\n",
    "# automatic feature selection like Lasso does. OLS may be prone to overfitting when dealing with high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In summary, Lasso Regression is powerful for feature selection and regularization, particularly when dealing with datasets with many\n",
