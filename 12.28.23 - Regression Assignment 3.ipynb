    "# Ridge Regression is a technique used in regression analysis to tackle multicollinearity and overfitting in models. It's\n",
    "# an extension of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression that adds a penalty term to the regression equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here’s how Ridge Regression differs from OLS:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Objective Function: OLS aims to minimize the residual sum of squares (RSS), which represents the difference between the observed\n",
    "# and predicted values. Ridge Regression minimizes a modified RSS by adding a penalty term, called the L2 regularization term.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Penalty Term: In Ridge Regression, the L2 regularization term is proportional to the square of the magnitude of coefficients, multiplied\n",
    "# by a regularization parameter (lambda or alpha). This penalizes the coefficients, shrinking them towards zero but rarely making them\n",
    "# exactly zero. In OLS, there's no penalty term involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Solution: OLS has a closed-form solution, meaning it can be solved directly using mathematical formulas. Ridge Regression is usually\n",
    "# solved using optimization algorithms because of the added penalty term.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Handling multicollinearity: Ridge Regression is particularly useful when there is multicollinearity among predictor variables. It can help\n",
    "# stabilize and improve the estimates of the coefficients by reducing their variance, even if this comes at the expense of introducing some\n",
    "# bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Overfitting control: Ridge Regression helps to prevent overfitting by shrinking the coefficients, making the model less sensitive to noise\n",
    "# in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In essence, while OLS seeks to minimize the sum of squared differences between observed and predicted values, Ridge Regression adds a\n",
    "# regularization term to this goal, aiming to find a balance between fitting the data well and keeping the model simpler to avoid overfitting."
